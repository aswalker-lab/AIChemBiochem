    "You will often find yourself reusing the same code over and over again\n",
    "To avoid having to retype the code, you can create functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that python already has many built-in functions, as well as built-in and installable libraries which also offer many functions. So if you are doing something simple, there is a good chance a function already exists for it!\n",
    "This can save you code and if there are multiple ways to code the function, the already availble one is likely to be the most efficient way to do something. Therefore, there is no reason to reinvent the wheel, but writing your own functions even if they exist already can be good way to improve your general coding skills"
