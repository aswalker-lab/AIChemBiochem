    "# Exercise 1 Chem Template\n",
    "In this exercise we will write a class that calculates correltaion between various molecular features (e.g. h bond donor) and solubility. We will also look at how the precense of either a h bond donor or acceptor affects solubility. You do not need to graph any of this data, but it is recommended that you try it for additional practice and to see how the values you get relate to how the graph looks. It is recommended that you use rdkit to calculate all molecular properties. Use the delaney.csv available in this folder of the github as an example to run your code on."
